/**
 * A path finder that finds a given number of shortest paths between two nodes. It is different from {@link org.neo4j.graphalgo.impl.path.ShortestPath}
 * because it allows to specify the desired number of results and path ordering, optionally based on a total path cost.
 * <p/>
 * Provided that there are enough paths between the two nodes in the graph, this path finder will first return all the
 * shortest paths, then all the paths one hop longer, then two hops longer, etc., until enough paths have been returned.
 * <p/>
 * If {@link PathFinderInput#getSortOrder()} is {@link com.graphaware.module.algo.path.SortOrder#LENGTH_ASC_THEN_COST_ASC} or
 * {@link com.graphaware.module.algo.path.SortOrder#LENGTH_ASC_THEN_COST_DESC}, then {@link PathFinderInput#getCostProperty()}
 * must also be provided and paths with the same length are ordered by total cost ascending or descending, respectively.
 * <p/>
 * Please note that relationships that are on a path with certain length will not be considered for paths with greater lengths.
 * For example, given the following graph:
 * <p/>
 * (1)->(2)->(3)
 * (1)->(4)->(5)->(3)
 * (4)->(2)
 * <p/>
 * the shortest path from (1) to (3) is (1)->(2)->(3) and has a length of 2. If more paths are needed, the next path
 * returned will be (1)->(4)->(5)->(3) with a length of 3. Note that there is another path of length 3:
 * (1)->(4)->(2)->(3), but it is not returned, since (2)->(3) is contained in a shorter path.
