/**
 * Encapsulation of parameters for path finders, with fluent interface.
 * The default maximum traversal depth is 3, the default maximum number of results (paths) is {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE},
 * and the default relationships to be traversed are all relationships in all directions. {@link org.neo4j.graphdb.RelationshipType}s
 * and {@link org.neo4j.graphdb.Direction}s can be explicitly added, which overrides the default "traverse-all" policy.
 * <p/>
 * The default sorting for paths is by increasing length, where the sorting of paths with the same length is undefined.
 * This can be overridden by explicitly setting a different ordering (which sorts paths with the same length using a cost
 * defined on each relationship), in which case the relationship property representing that cost must also be defined
 * (using {@link com.graphaware.module.algo.path.PathFinderInput#setCostProperty(String)}).
 * <p/>
 * This class is not thread-safe, it should not be shared among threads (there should be no reason to do so).
